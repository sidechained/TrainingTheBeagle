## Essential Resources

This document is a selection of important resources for newcomers to the Beaglebone Black. For resources related to specific topics please see the [individual tutorials](../../Tutorials), and for a less organised list of links to interesting projects and sites, see [non-essential-resources](../non-essential/non-essential-resources.md).

### Official Links

* [Official Beagleboard Website](http://beagleboard.org)
* [Official Beaglebone Black Wiki](http://elinux.org/Beagleboard:BeagleBoneBlack): Contains links to the latest PDF documentation including the System Reference Manual (see Hardware Files sections)

### Community Resources: Wiki's, Fora and Quick Reference Docs

* [Official Beaglebone Black Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!categories/beagleboard/beaglebone-black): Many questions or problems you will encounter will have already been discussed here
* [Beaglebone Community Wiki](http://elinux.org/BeagleBone_Community): Good collection of info drawn from the user community
* [Beaglebone Black Pin Reference](http://stuffwemade.net/hwio/beaglebone-pin-reference/): Decent pin reference - beware, some online pin references are wrong (e.g. mixing up of P8 and P9)!

### Libraries and Extensions

* [Adafruit BBIO Library](https://github.com/adafruit/adafruit-beaglebone-io-python): Probably the best library for interfacing with the Beaglebone pin headers. Written in Python. Also see the adafruit tutorial about how to use this library (a good introduction which covers most of the features).
* [pyOSC](https://trac.v2.nl/wiki/pyOSC): Open Sound Control library for Python

### Guides and Tutorials

* ["Getting Started with BeagleBone" Book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028116.do): Good book which covers "Linux-Powered Electronic Projects With Python and JavaScript"
* [Makezine Getting Started Guide](http://makezine.com/projects/make-32/get-started-with-beaglebone/): Useful introductory tutorial
* [Adafruit Tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/category/beaglebone): Excellent selection of tutorials which use the Adafruit BBIO library to interfaces with sensors, LEDs etc.
* [GPIO Tutorial](http://shallowsky.com/blog/hardware/beaglebone-black-gpio.html): Basic tutorial about GPIO using Adafruit (doesn't add much that the BBIO library doesn't cover itself)
* [Various Tutorials from Cameon](http://beaglebone.cameon.net/home): "Control RC servos, read analog values like temperatures, control relays, control leds and any logic device, read buttons and more."

### Linux on ARM

* [Prepackaged ARM HF Linux Images](http://www.armhf.com): for Ubuntu and Debian (wheezy)
* [Linux on ARM](http://eewiki.net/display/linuxonarm/BeagleBone+Black): Tutorial on how to build your own Linux on ARM system (by guru Robert Nelson)
